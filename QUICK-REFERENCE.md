# 🎯 Quick Reference - What to Build Next

## ⚠️ **Critical Missing Features**

Your game is **33% complete** with excellent foundations, but these 4 features are BLOCKING playability:

### 1. ❌ **CRAFTING SYSTEM** (Lesson 11)
**Problem:** Can't combine items or create anything new  
**Impact:** No progression, just collecting  
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **DO THIS FIRST!**  
**Time:** 1-2 weeks  
**Lines of Code:** ~800

**What to Build:**
```java
class CraftingRecipe {
    Map<TileType, Integer> ingredients;
    ItemStack result;
    
    // Example: 4 Wood → 1 Crafting Table
    // Example: 3 Iron + 2 Sticks → 1 Pickaxe
}
```

---

### 2. ❌ **TOOL SYSTEM** (Lesson 12)
**Problem:** All blocks break at same speed, no progression  
**Impact:** Mining is boring, no reason to upgrade  
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **DO THIS SECOND!**  
**Time:** 1 week  
**Lines of Code:** ~600

**What to Build:**
```java
class Tool {
    ToolType type;        // PICKAXE, AXE, SHOVEL
    ToolTier tier;        // WOOD, STONE, IRON, GOLD
    int durability;
    float miningSpeed;
    
    // Wood pickaxe: 30 uses, 1.5x speed on stone
    // Iron pickaxe: 100 uses, 3x speed on stone
}
```

---

### 3. ❌ **SAVE/LOAD SYSTEM** (Lesson 14)
**Problem:** World resets when game closes  
**Impact:** GAME IS UNPLAYABLE LONG-TERM  
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **CRITICAL!**  
**Time:** 1 week  
**Lines of Code:** ~500

**What to Build:**
```java
class WorldSerializer {
    void saveWorld(World world, Player player, String filename);
    World loadWorld(String filename);
    
    // Save: world tiles, player position, inventory, time
    // Format: JSON or binary
    // Auto-save every 5 minutes
}
```

---

### 4. ❌ **EQUIPMENT SYSTEM** (Lesson 13)
**Problem:** Can't defend yourself, no weapon variety  
**Impact:** Combat is boring and too hard  
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **DO THIS THIRD!**  
**Time:** 1 week  
**Lines of Code:** ~600

**What to Build:**
```java
class Equipment {
    EquipmentType type;   // HELMET, CHEST, LEGS, WEAPON
    int defense;          // Damage reduction
    int damage;           // Weapon damage
    
    // Iron Helmet: +5 defense
    // Iron Sword: 15 damage
    // Full Iron Set: +15 defense total
}
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Start with Lesson 11 (Crafting)**
This is the foundation for everything else. Once you have crafting, tools and equipment naturally follow.

### **Don't Skip Save/Load**
It seems boring but it's ESSENTIAL. Without it, nobody can actually play your game for more than one session.

### **Test Frequently**
After each feature, play for 30 minutes to make sure it's fun and balanced.

### **Keep It Simple First**
Start with basic recipes and simple tools. You can always add complexity later.

### **Use JSON for Save Files**
It's human-readable, debuggable, and easy to work with:
```json
{
  "world": {
    "seed": 12345,
    "tiles": "...",
    "time": 0.5
  },
  "player": {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 50,
    "health": 80,
    "inventory": [...]
  }
}
```
